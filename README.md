# Lecture Notes for MIT 16.S897, Spring 2026

This repository contains LaTeX lecture notes for __MIT 16.S897: Spacecraft Attitude Determination & Control__, as taught in the Spring 2026 semester by Prof. Z. Manchester.

I take no credit for the content of these notes; I have purely typeset them for my own enrichment and am sharing them as a courtesy to other students in the course.

Handwritten lecture notes may be found on Z. Manchester's GitHub link: [zacmanchester/spacecraft-attitude-course](https://github.com/zacmanchester/spacecraft-attitude-course/)

Lecture videos may be found on YouTube: [@roboticexplorationlab](https://www.youtube.com/@roboticexplorationlab).

## Topics

The lecture notes cover the following topics.

- `lecture01`: history of attitude determination and control systems (ADCS) engineering, attitude parameterization methods, rotation matrices

- `lecture02`: rotation matrix kinematics, quaternions

- `lecture03`: quaternions, quaternion kinematics, rigid-body dynamics

- `lecture04`: rigid-body dynamics, Euler's equation, stability of solutions

## Errors

We are all human!  If you find any errors, typographical, mathematical, or otherwise, I'd be very grateful to you for letting me know so I can keep these notes as accurate as possible.
